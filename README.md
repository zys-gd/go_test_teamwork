Package customerimporter reads from a CSV file and returns a sorted (data
structure of your choice) of email domains along with the number of customers
with e-mail addresses for each domain. This should be able to be ran from the
CLI and output the sorted domains to the terminal or to a file. Any errors
should be logged (or handled). Performance matters (this is only ~3k lines,
but could be 1m lines or run on a small machine).
